# Contributing

Looking to contribute? All types of help are appreciated, from coding to testing and feature specification.&#x20;

If you are a developer and would like to contribute with some code, please open an issue to discuss before opening a Pull Request. We have also defined some [Good First Issue tasks](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which should give a good introduction to the app with minimal complexity.

Information about the project setup can be found in the [development documentation](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md)
