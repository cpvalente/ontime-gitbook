# Roll

Roll is an advanced feature that allows ontime to run standalone by using the system clock

Once running, the app will find the event that should be running and set timers accordingly



**There are known hiccups in the feature on timers that go over midnight**

* A end time earlier than a start time is not recognised in roll mode



{% hint style="warning" %}
Note delay blocks do not affect the rolling behaviour until permanently applied.

See delays in the [Blocks Help](broken-reference)
