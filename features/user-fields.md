# User fields

User fields allow for custom naming of additional data fields on each event (eg. light, sound, camera).

There are ten available fields (user0 - user9). These fields are currently only exposed on [Excel Import ](import-events-from-excel.md)and shown in the [cuesheet view](../views/cuesheet.md).

The fields' names are controlled in the Editor's [cuesheet settings](../main-concepts/interface-1/application-settings/cuesheet-settings.md)
