# Edit Anywhere

{% hint style="info" %}
TLRD; Navigate to `IP_ADDRESS:4001/editor` to be able to edit the app from any device in the network
{% endhint %}

Just like all the other viewers in ontime, the editor interface (that is used in the app) is available in the local network.

It is highly discouraged that ontime is part of a public network, and should be kept in a closed, production network. To add additional protection to the app state, you can use a pincode defined in the [App Settings ](broken-reference)that protects the editor page.
