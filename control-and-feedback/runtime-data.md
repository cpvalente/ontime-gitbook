# Runtime Data

Ontime broadcasts its state over websockets on port 4001. This allows for integrations to sync to the state of the application. This broadcast happens at least once a second, depending on updates.

See below a full definition of the data that Ontime holds. You would use the Integrations feature to share these.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The object broadcast object is formatted as below. With the type 'ontime' indicating that this is the application state update

`{`\
&#x20; `type: ontime,`\
&#x20; `payload: <RuntimeState>  (see below)`\
`}`
