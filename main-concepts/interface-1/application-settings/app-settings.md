General settings for the application

* **Viewer Port**: The port where ontime is available
* **Editor pin code**: protect the /editor route with the pincode defined here. Leave empty for no protection

* **View language**: Language to be used in views

{% hint style="info" %}
View language

We can translate some parts of the application into a few languages.&#x20;

Maybe we got something wrong? Maybe you would like your language to be added. [Open an issue on GitHub ](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues)or get in touch with [mail@getontime.no](mailto:mail@getontime.no)

This affects only the consumer views and not the working views such as /editor and /cuesheet
