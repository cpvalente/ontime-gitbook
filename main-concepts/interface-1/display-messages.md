# Display Messages

#### 4. Display Messages

The Display Messages features allow sending real-time information for different types of views.

A typical use case would be sending a message to the speaker screen onstage with instructions on time or the presentation.

As of now, there are three separate messages possible

* [Stage Timer / Presenter Screen](../../views/stage-timer.md)
* [Public Screen](../../views/public-info.md)
* [Lower Third](../../views/lower-thirds.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
Using the visibility button to toggle on / off the message. You are able to type while the message is visible.
{% endhint %}
